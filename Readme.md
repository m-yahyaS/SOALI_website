## Mohamed Yahya SOALI

I am currently a third year student at Ecole Polytechnique (X) majoring in Optimization and Operations research. You can find my CV [here] () (last updated December 15th 2020).

# Research Projects :

* Sizing of an intervention center on an electrical distribution network
***Supervisors : St√©phane Gaubert, Xavier Allamigeon, Pascale Bendotti and Thomas Triboulet.***
- Modelled and analyzed a Call center workflow using timed Petri nets.
- Determined, with a theoretical and simulation based research, the optimal priority routing policy on the center's activities.

* Non-Linear Dimensionality reduction using ISOMAP
***Supervisor : Juan-Antonio Cordero-Fuertes.***
- Studied in depth of state-of-art constrained shortest path algorithms.
- Applied to the study of key elements in datasets (by reducing the dimension).

* Optimizing user distribution over communication channels
***Supervisor : Benjamin Doerr and Marceau Coupechoux.***
- Compared efficiency of different approaches (Greedy, LP solvers, Dynamic Programming and Branch and Bound) to solve a multi-choice knapsack problem.

* Trajectory planning and control of collaborative systems
***Supervisor : Eric Goubault and Sylvie Putot.***
- Built a drone's control platform for the computer science department of l'X.
- Trajectory planning algorithms for obstacle avoidance.

# Course Projects :

* Chess data analysis and visualization
***Supervisor : Pierre Bourhis.***
- Purified and analyzed chess game databases.
- Used knowledge graphs to extract game strategies to be advised to beginners (Neo4j, Gephi).

* Predicting the age of Abalones 
***Supervisor : Karim Lounici.***
- Cleaned and analyzed the data.
- Build a regression model for prediction.
